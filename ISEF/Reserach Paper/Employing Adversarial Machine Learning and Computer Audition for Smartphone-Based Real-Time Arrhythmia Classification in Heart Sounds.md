    - Introduction
        - As part of any routine physical exam, a healthcare provider will listen to a patientsâ€™ heart with a stethoscope. This procedure â€“ cardiac auscultation â€“ is a 200+ year old method to screen for heart defects, and requires the examining provider to have acute hearing and extensive experience. Traditional cardiac auscultation relies 100% on the subjective interpretation of heart sounds by the examiner. An accurate diagnosis remains challenging for reasons including faint heart sounds, noise, breathing, high heart rates, and having to distinguish innocent from pathological murmurs.
        - **stats about how many arrhiymse get mis diognisted each year**
        - **effect of late surgury**
        - future health care will be automated
        - Rural communities with limited medical device technologies available, both foreign and domestic.
        - Telemedicine (increasing in popularity post-pandemic).
        - Integration with other "health" apps: Apple Health, Fitbit, Whoop, MyFitnessPal, etc.Watch-out: HIPPA violations.
            - I recall during my time at J&J they were developing an external piece of hardware you could attach to your smartphone camera which would turn it into an otoscope. Then you would scope your own ear, the tech would take and analyze the images and tell you of any medical issues in your ear like inflammation, infection, etc. I think other companies beyond J&J may have similar products. This arrhythmia detection app to me sounds like it would be in the same ballpark, so perhaps you could piggy-back off commentary those companies have published.
